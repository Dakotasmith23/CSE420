when do we need to use free()??
I thought we were supposed to use it after we use malloc() but in the 
insert_node() function provided to us it is not used there.


Having trouble finding out why my test2 is failing for the blackbox testing.


heap is memory that can be used from alloc()


FIX:
ignore files starting with "." (hidden files)
look at notes
